**SuiSec** is a team dedicated to the security of the [Sui](https://sui.io) ecosystem, having developed a suite of security plugins.

## [DryRunTransactionBlockResponsePlus](https://github.com/RandyPen/DryRunTransactionBlockResponsePlus)

The original simulated transaction information on Sui is overly complex, which may lead to users signing transactions without noticing crucial details, thus falling for scams.

This plugin will extract and present the most relevant information to the user.
